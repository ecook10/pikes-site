<p><strong>Head Rush Chairman: Matt Parker (Sophomore) (206) 802-8190</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/rush/ParkerMatt.jpg" alt="Matt Parker" />I am from Bainbridge Island, Washington. At first, I was completely against joining a fraternity. I thought they were all the same, filled with guys who didn’t care about school and simply partied all the time. During the summer before school started, all my friends began rushing at the various fraternities and they tried to get me to come along, but I held my ground. When I came to school, I thought I’d be happy in the dorms. I thought the dorms would give me a quiet place to study, but still have the social interaction with others that I needed. After finding myself bored on many nights, I ended up going to check out some fraternities just for fun. My first time coming to Pi Kappa Alpha was unlike any of my other visits to fraternities. The guys were so cool and they loved sports. After getting to know them, I realized that like me, studies were the top priority. They had proven my preconceived notion that all fraternities were the same, wrong. When I found out that nearly every one in the house was athletic and played sports all their lives, like me, I was sold. Since joining this house, I have found myself as rush chair. Joining Pikes was the best decision I have ever made because my grades have improved, I¢ve made the best friends that I know I can count on for the rest of my life, and I am having the most fun in my entire life. My only regret is that I didn’t join right when I got here.</p>

<p><strong>Rush Chairman: Jay Schuler (Sophomore) (206)459-6662</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/rush/SchulerJay.jpg" alt="Jay Schuler" />I’m from Mercer Island, Washington. I started the rushing process because both of my parents were in the Greek System here at UW and they both have made very lasting friendships and connections with people who they are still involved with to this day, and I wanted that same opportunity. I visited quite a few different houses around campus, but after a short time it became clear to me that I wanted to be a member of Pi Kappa Alpha. I felt that it was much easier to make connections with the Pikes that I met because they were so welcoming and outgoing every time that I was  around them. Also, I was pretty big on sports in high school and Pikes is the obvious choice as far as athletics go. Lastly, this seemed like a place which could be helpful in fostering a good academic environment, which is the whole reason I’m attending college.</p>

<p><strong>Rush Chairman: Drew McWhirter (Freshman) (425) 647-6369</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/rush/McWhirterDrew.jpg" alt="Drew McWhirter" />I graduated from Redmond high school in 2012. I have moved 3 significant times in my life and lived in California, Hawaii, and Washington. Through my moving experiences I became very good at meeting new people and making friends.I knew Greek life was the life for me and I began rushing the summer before my freshman year. I rushed about 10 houses and when I rushed Pikes I could tell the connection was different. Everyone seemed very down to earth, laid back, and very friendly. After hanging out a few days during the summer and attending some parties I really loved how connected everyone in the house seemed and how accepting they all were towards me.<br />
    Joining Pikes has been the best decision I have made in my college career. It has helped me in numerous ways academically, mentally, socially, athletically. It is nice to know that I have so many brothers that have my back at all times. It is so easy to get help on homework or studying with over 80 brothers in our house. I can always trust my brothers to keep me on the right track. Being involved in my fraternity has helped me make life long connections and friendships that I am so thankful for. It has truly helped me grow as a person and mature as I entered into a new environment. I plan to stay involved as much as I can and lead my chapter in the right direction.<br />
    Pi Kappa Alpha has become more than just a fraternity, but a family in itself. There is nothing better than living in a house with all of your best friends and being a part of an organization that benefits individuals and the surrounding community.</p>

<p><strong>Rush Chairman: Heath Brinkman (Freshman) (360) 907-1016</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/rush/BrinkmanHeath.jpg" alt="Heath Brinkman" />I came to University of Washington from Vancouver, Washington. My decision to join the greek community was greatly influenced by the positive experiences of my older friends when they attended the University. During the rush process I felt alienated at many houses but Pikes was different. I was treated as an equal, and I felt that I had found a community of men that I could see myself being a part of. They were well spoken, knew how to have a good time and had none of the stereotypical aversions that I had seen at other houses. I spent my first quarter as an assistant rush chairman, hoping to grow the house to increased greatness. Since joining, I have found Pikes to be one of the most supportive, interesting and exciting groups of people I have ever met. I know that the friends I make here will be there for the rest of my life.</p>

<p><strong>Rush Chairman: Ransom Hatch (Freshman) 253-534-5104</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/rush/HatchRansom.jpg" alt="Ransom Hatch" />I am originally from Tacoma, WA and what really sparked my interest in the Greek System was my best friend from high school who told me to check it out. Being of the Mormon religion, I thought the Greek System was nothing but a ton of people who partied all the time. But as I rushed around I found that it was more than just a place to kick it. I found guys that shared my same interests, could help me with my schooling and much more. I felt especially at home at Pikes and I have felt no peer pressure whatsoever to compromise my beliefs and values. I loved how the guys in the house were so awesome and if you wanted to do something, there would always be at least one person down to do it with you.<br />
    Pikes has enriched my life in so many different ways. I am fostering new lifelong friendships, networking with people all over campus, talking to Alumni about my plans after graduation and most of all, enjoying my time at school. Pi Kappa Alpha is more than a Fraternity, I feel like I have another family on my side and I know that every person in my house has my back. There are no cliques and there aren’t any groups. It is just a community of brothers that are banded together for life.</p>
