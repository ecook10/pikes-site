<h1>Anti-Hazing</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER STATEMENT OF POSITION ON HAZING</h2>
<p>Each chapter of The Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity recognizes the Fraternity&#8217;s <em>Standards</em>, which include a standard of <span style="text-decoration: underline">absolutely no hazing</span>.</p>

<p>Many have experienced hazing in high school, either as a new member of  an athletic team, a school band or a school social group. Hazing is  often glorified in movies, and can take many forms. The most serious is  direct physical abuse, such as being paddled, to a milder form, such as  push-ups, to subtler approaches, such as drinking games.</p>

<p>Each chapter is aware that hazing is not acceptable conduct for any  members to inflict upon one another and that no one should submit to any  form of hazing as a condition of membership. Every member should <span style="text-decoration: underline">refuse to participate in any hazing activity</span> and, as importantly, should <span style="text-decoration: underline">refuse to permit hazing being inflicted upon them</span>.</p>

<p>If a member is approached and asked to participate in an activity which may be considered hazing:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The member should refuse to participate in hazing; and</li>
    <li>Know that such refusal will not place his membership in Pi Kappa Alpha at risk; and</li>
    <li>Immediately report it to a chapter officer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose in providing this information is not because any members  intend to haze pledges. However, when there are several personalities in  a chapter, there is a remote possibility that some individual may, on  the spur of the moment, ignore the Chapter&#8217;s prohibition on hazing, and  attempt a hazing activity with a pledge. Everyone should understand  their rights and not be intimidated.</p>

<p><strong>Each member has a personal responsibility not to condone any sort of hazing.</strong></p>
