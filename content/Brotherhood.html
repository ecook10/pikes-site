<h1>Brotherhood</h1>

<p>Brotherhood is easily one of the most important aspects of success and happiness. It is essential in order to reach your maximum potential in college, your career, and life itself. Making friends is a simple and natural process, but brotherhood goes far beyond that. The bonds that the brothers of Pi Kappa Alpha share are built up to last a lifetime. For some brothers, these bonds have developed from ties prior to their experience at the University of Washington, and others meet for the first time during their pledge quarter. But, regardless of when these bonds begin to grow, the rush process, pledge quarter and I-week are purposefully designed to ensure that all members are worthy of the bonds Pikes has to offer.</p>

<p>Pikes ethic of brotherly love ensures that the brotherhood stands strong. During pledge quarter, new members are paired with a big brother in the house to help mentor them through their years in the fraternity. The new members then become the newest edition to their big brothers Greek Family, which is a great way to make close friends throughout the Greek system. We also set up brotherhoods throughout the quarter that can be fun, entertaining, intellectual, useful, professional, or casual. Some examples of brotherhood events weÂ¢ve had include movie nights, golf tournaments, camping and hiking outings, ski trips, canoeing adventures, and many more.</p>

<p>Through member involvement and the memorable events in store, the brotherhood experience at PIKES Beta Beta is one that is certain to last a lifetime.</p>
