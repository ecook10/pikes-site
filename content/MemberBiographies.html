<h3>Justin Lester  - Junior – Beta Sigma Pledge Class</h3>

<p>I grew up on the Plateau in Sammamish, WA and attended Eastlake High School. As a sports fanatic, it was an easy decision to join Pikes. The brothers in this house all share the same interests and get along so easily, which was the main reason why I joined. When I was rushing, I felt the most comfortable when I was at Pikes. Now that I am in the house, there is always something to do and someone to do it with you. Joining Pikes was the best decision I have made in my life, as I now have tons of lifelong friends that have been through the ups and downs with me. Pikes has given me everlasting memories with my brothers but has also transformed me from a boy to a young man. Through the pledging process and many educational opportunities with PIKE, I have immensely grown as a person during my time in this fraternity.</p>

<h3>Kevin Thruelsen – Junior – Beta Phi Pledge Class</h3>

<p>I was born and raised in Issaquah, WA and the first member of my family to join a fraternity. What really attracted me to fraternity life was the sense of brotherhood that extended from my enlistment in the United States Army. At the UW “Meet the Greeks” campus event, I met the Pike Brothers who dressed professionally and immediately engaged me in conversation, espousing the virtues of their organization. Right away I was interested and wrote my name on the call-back list.<br />

Upon joining the house I’ve gained a community of my peers, a best friend (my Greek big brother), a social experience I have never had, and connections outside of college through the mentorship program. I can safely say that rushing, pledging and being initiated as a brother of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity has been one of the most substantial and important decisions I have ever made and I would not trade it for anything.</p>

<h3>Austin Strand – Freshman – Beta Psi Pledge Class</h3>

<p>I¢ve lived in Mukilteo/Everett my entire life. I have a twin brother who is currently enrolled at UW as well. Coming into college, I initially thought I’d dorm with my best friend from high school but soon realized that I was looking for something much more, something that would allow me to be more social and have more experiences in college. Unlike my twin brother, I was led to the UW greek system where I soon became familiar with the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity. I quickly realized that I enjoyed hanging out with everyone at Pikes and I knew that it was the place for me. Here at pikes I’ve already learned that I have what it takes to be a leader, to follow direction, and to be a brother to those that welcome it. I’ve also learned that a brother isn’t something that is only blood related, but also something that is created through trust and respect. I hope to continue to broaden my experiences here at pikes and to continue my education in a productive and positive manner.</p>

<h3>Sam Ourada - Freshman – Beta Psi Pledge Class</h3>

<p>I was born in Boston, MA and moved to Mukilteo, WA where I attended Kamiak High School. I was the first member of my family to join a fraternity and I have been very happy with my decision. I joined Pi Kappa Alpha a couple weeks into fall quarter and I was still able to be a part of the fall pledge class. After I joined, everyone was very welcoming and I know now that I couldn¢t have made a better decision. There is almost always something to do at the house and if there isn¢t, someone will always be willing to find something to do. Overall, the social experience at Pikes has been one of a kind and has led me to meet many new friends and brothers.</p>

<h3>Shon Purdy – Freshman – Beta Psi Pledge Class</h3>

<p>I have lived in Gig Harbor Washington all of my life. I have a brother (Evan Purdy) who is a junior and a Pike at UW. Initially I never really pictured myself joining a fraternity, but with frequent trips throughout my senior year in high school to visit my brother at Pikes, that picture quickly changed. Every time I visited Pikes I had a great time. Everyone there was always welcome and friendly, which is part of the reason I ended up joining pikes. I never went through a formal rush because I knew Pikes was where I wanted to be. Throughout the short time that I have been at Pikes I have established friendships that I know will last a lifetime. Pikes has shown me what it takes to become a man and a true leader. It has also stressed the importance of getting a good education. I did not have very good study habits in high school but the brothers at Pikes have helped me, and my study habits and grades have improved. I still have much to learn in life but I know being a Pike will help me learn valuable life lessons and skills that will help me be the best man I can be.</p>

<h3>Milan Basra – Freshman – Beta Psi Pledge Class</h3>

<p>I was born in Vancouver, BC and moved to Redmond, WA before the eighth grade. I never thought I would join a fraternity but towards the end of senior year I made the decision to rush to see what Greek life was like. After rushing a few houses I liked what I saw and made the decision to join Pikes because I felt like it was the place for me. Since joining the house I have made memories and friendships that will last a lifetime and in the process have also come to realize the strength behind the bonds of brotherhood. Pikes has taught me how to be a better man, leader, and member of society leaving me with a truly unforgettable experience.</p>

<h3>Nick Nguyen – Sophomore – Beta Psi Pledge Class</h3>

<p>I grew up in Lynnwood, WA. For my first year at this school I lived at home and felt really out of place in the university community.  I immediately found it difficult to meet anybody new or to meet up with my old friends. I knew that joining a fraternity would be the right step to connecting with people at UW. I sought a fraternity that represents the same ideals that I tend to base myself upon. I wanted one where I could feel like a member of a family, strives to represent itself as a strong community in the university, and a strong sense of its own values. I myself have always put family in front of everything else, and seeking a fraternity where I could feel like a family was key. This is needed with members who put the idea of a brotherhood high in their list of priorities. Pikes showed me just that, as I immediately felt welcome and quickly created bonds with both the brothers and my pledge brothers that I feel could last for a long time. I have always been a very social person, and so to be able to feel welcome and willing to be open in a fraternity I had not even signed with yet made me feel like I was already one of them all. Pikes also seemed to want to continue to be one of the best chapters in the nation and one of the best fraternities in the school, which lined up with my values of a strong sense of goals and direction. I wanted a fraternity where there was a strong drive to succeed, and I quickly found that in an award-winning chapter of a strong fraternity. Finally, the idea of SLAG gave me a reason to understand what it is Pikes stood for. To be able to want men who value scholarship, leadership, athletics and to be a gentleman was cognitive of people who knew what they were doing with their lives, and to be able to stick to a sense of values. I didn¢t always know that I wanted to join a fraternity, but I now know it was one of the best decisions of my life. Pi Kappa Alpha has and will set a lasting impression on the man I am, and the man I have yet to become.</p>

<h3>Akash Puri – Freshman – Beta Psi Pledge Class</h3>

<p>My name is Akash Puri and I am currently a pledge of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity Beta Beta chapter here at the University of Washington. Growing up in the small town of Centralia, the adjustment of moving into such a large city has been a tough one. The fact that I had very few friends from my hometown here made the adjustment even worse. I don¢t know what I would have done if I didn¢t join Pikes. Never before in my life have I been able to make such strong friendships in such a short period of time. If you want to go grab a bite to eat, go work out or shoot some hoops, need someone to work on math homework with, or just someone to play video games with, you will always have someone to accompany you within your house. What set Pikes apart from other houses though was their focus on brotherhood and S.L.A.G. (Scholarship, Leadership, Athletics, and Gentlemanly Qualities). Balance has always been important to me. I learned quickly in high school, while being involved in so many different sports, clubs, and other activities, that in order to be truly successful in life you need to balance the things most important to you. Pike¢s slogan of SLAG captured exactly what I felt crucial aspects of success in my life. The four values represented are truly representatives of what I seek in pursuit of success as a man. The brotherhood within the house has also been overwhelming. It is quite evident as one walks back home from class and sees fellow pikes on the way and gets that warm feeling of pride knowing that you are a part of something special. I plan on pursuing a degree in Computer Science at UW. Though CSE majors are rare in the Greek system compared to business, the diversity within Pikes has offered me more than a few brothers who have already taken CSE classes. I don¢t think I could imagine living outside of Pikes at the University of Washington, and have already gained so much from my short tenure as a pledge.</p>

<h3>Cody Gibb – Freshman – Beta Psi Pledge Class</h3>

<p>I was born and raised in Lafayette, California, a suburb right outside of Berkeley. I decided to go to UW because of its top ranked computer science school, but unlike many other prospective computer science majors, I decided to join a fraternity. While rushing, I instantly identified Pikes as the fraternity I wanted to join after seeing the strong friendships that bonded the brothers of Pi Kappa Alpha together and the values and principles they held. For me, college is a time of self-improvement and connecting with new people. The qualities of SLAG are the exact aspects of my life that I want to improve, and there is no better place than Pikes to meet new friends and form expansive networks. Already after my short time at Pikes, I have formed friendships that I will treasure for decades.</p>

<h3>Viet Nguyen – Sophomore – Beta Upsilon Pledge Class</h3>

<p>I was born and raised in Olympia, Washington. Olympia is a predominantly liberal area with a small town feel. Coming to such a large city in Seattle from a suburb, the transition was hard at first because of the sheer volume. Being in a setting with over 40,000 students was a step out of my comfort zone. The make the community smaller, I sought joining a fraternity where I easily meet friends that would help make the transition smoother. The size of the Greek System was incomprehensible at first with 32 different fraternities. Rushing around a majority of them, the one where I felt most comfortable and believe would further my collegiate experience was Pi Kappa Alpha. All the brothers in the house shared the same interest as I did and were more than welcoming. Every fraternity puts on different illusion of what fraternity life should really be but Pikes was the one fraternity that I could see past the formalities. Now being in my second year at the house, joining Pi Kappa Alpha has been the best decision that I have made in my life.</p>
