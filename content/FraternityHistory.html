<h1>Fraternity History</h1>

<p>The  Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity was founded at the University of Virginia on  March 1, 1868. At the time, the University of Virginia was the fifth  largest school in the United States, and was considered the first truly  American state university, because it was the first to be established  totally free from religious control.</p>

<p>It all started in Room 47 West Range when Frederick Southgate Taylor  turned to Littleton Waller Tazewell, his cousin and roommate, for help  in starting a new fraternity. Also present were James Benjamin Sclater,  Jr., a schoolmate of Tazewell, and Sclater&#8217;s roommate, Robertson Howard.  Those four men voted to add a fifth to their group and chose Julian  Edward Wood. In addition, William Alexander, probably a friend of  Sclater, was proposed for membership and admitted as a founder.</p>

<p>The essence of the Founders&#8217; vision for Pi Kappa Alpha can be found  in its Preamble. A committee was first suggested by Brother William  Alexander &#8220;to draw up a statement of the origin and the organization of  the Fraternity.&#8221; The committee was composed of brothers Robertson Howard  and Littleton Waller Tazewell.</p>

<p>The resulting statement is now referred to as the Preamble.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;For the establishment of friendship on a firmer and more lasting  basis; for the promotion of brotherly love and kind feeling; for the  mutual benefit and advancement of the interests of those with whom we  sympathize and deem worthy of our regard; We have resolved to form a  fraternity, believing that, thus we can most successfully accomplish our  object.&#8221;</em></p>
